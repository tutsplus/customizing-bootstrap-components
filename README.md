### Envato Tuts+ Course: [Customizing Bootstrap Components](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/customizing-bootstrap-components)

Not all Bootstrap websites have to look and behave like Bootstrap websites. In this course, I’ll teach you how to customize Bootstrap components to fit the needs of your site without making it look like every other Bootstrap site out there.

#### Source Files Description:
